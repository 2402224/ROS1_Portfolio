# ROS1 Portfolio
This portfolio documents my learning journey and practical exercises in ROS1 (Robot Operating System), focusing on topics like simulation, navigation, and visualization.

1. Understanding the Problem Situation
We started by identifying what problem we’re trying to solve. In this case, the goal was to design a small-scale urban environment that manages human flow, signage, and centralized services. We needed to think about how people or robots would move through this space, what kind of obstacles they might face, and how they interact with the environment. So we looked at factors like navigation, accessibility, and visual communication.

2. Investigating Alternatives
Before finalizing the layout, we explored different possible solutions. For example, we considered alternative positions for the central hub, types of signs, and pathways. We thought about whether it should be a round plaza, a park, or maybe a tech hub. The layout of the signs and pedestrian access was also tested in different configurations to figure out what works best.

3. Modeling the System
The physical setup you see here is actually the system model. Everything in this model represents a subsystem:
The central structure might represent a water dispenser, charging station, or data hub.
The figures represent people interacting with the system.
The signs guide flow and decision-making.
The plants and flowers simulate a public space atmosphere and environmental system.
By modeling it this way, we were able to visualize and test how each part interacts in a controlled setting.

4. Integrating and Implementing the System
Then we focused on bringing all these parts together into a single, functional system. The paths, signage, central structure, and figures were arranged carefully so they don’t just exist on their own — they work as a whole. For instance, the signs aren’t just placed randomly; they’re oriented based on the expected human movement or robot navigation flow.

5. Deploying, Using, and Sustaining the System
In a real-world case, this would mean installing the system and keeping it running. For the model, we simulate this by having people or robots move through the space and test how intuitive or efficient the system is. We could then make adjustments based on how the "users" interact with the space — almost like collecting feedback and improving it continuously.

6. System Retirement
While this stage isn’t shown directly in the model, we still thought about it. For example, we designed the model to be modular, so pieces can be removed or updated. If the central hub becomes outdated, or if traffic patterns change, we can replace parts of the system without starting from scratch.
